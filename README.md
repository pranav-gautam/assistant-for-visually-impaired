# assistant-for-visually-impaired
In this project, we created a voice assistant using machine learning specifically aimed towards aiding the visually impaired.

This system is used to help the visually impaired have access to the most important features, enhancing their living conditions with the use of different custom layouts and speech-to-text technology. Hence, this system performs tasks based on the input (in the form of speech) given by the user and responds back as speech.

IMPORTANT FEATURES:

1) This assistant gives a single-line description of the surrounding details while identifying around 90% of the objects. 
2) It gives an overview of the road conditions. 
3) It also specifically mentions if the user is in the classroom, kitchen, bedroom, etc. 
4) It responds to the number of people, objects, etc. in the frame of the webcam. 
5) It also responds to commands like "Find my purse?" or "Check if my watch is in the room." 
6) It detects text from images and reads it aloud. 
7) It is also capable of summarizing articles from newspapers. 
8) It can help out in filling forms also. 
9) It can read notifications from mobile and, as a further application, respond to messages, emails, etc.

Currently, we are still working on adding new functionalities to this assistant so that it can be more helpful to those in need.

Thank you! :)
